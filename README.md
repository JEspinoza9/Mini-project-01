# Mini-project-01
This challenge had us create a landing page for a clients new website. This page should have a navigation bar with links to the corresponding pages like Github and the creators portfolio. This page also includes an image and some text promoting our new site coming soon. Lastly this page includes a contact form for visitors to recieve updated on the progress of the site. It is important to use semantic elements and include alt attributes to images to make sure our site is accesible and works as well as we can make it work. We also use CSS to style the page and make it more pleasing to the eye by changing colors, fonts, and editing the spacing between elements and what should go in those spaces.
